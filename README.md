# Intro to CLIs

## Learning Goals

- Use your Python skills to build an interactive command-line application.
- Follow best practices in CLI design in Python.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Command Line**: a text-based interface that is built into your computer's
operating system. It allows you to access the files and applications on your
computer manually or through scripts.
- **Terminal**: the application in Mac OS that allows you to access the command
line.
- **Command Shell/Powershell**: the applications in Windows that allow you to access
the command line.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: a text-based interface used to run programs,
manage files and interact with objects in memory. As the name suggests, it is
run from the command line.

## Introduction

Now that we're in the home stretch of Phase 3, it's time to prepare for your
project. You will see the rubric for the project in the next page in this
module, but before we get there, let's take some time to explore the format for
the project: a **command-line interface** (or **CLI**).

A CLI is a program that is run from the command-line and provides a text-based
interface to allow you to carry out various tasks. While the functionality of
CLIs is limited by the capabilities of Terminal (in Mac OS) and Command
Shell/Powershell (in Windows), _everything you have learned in Phase 3 can be
carries out through a CLI._

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

Instructions begin here:

- Make sure to specify any class, method, variable, module, package names
  that `pytest` will check for.
- Any other instructions go here.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
